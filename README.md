# Elucidating the factors associated with spontaneous clearance in acute HCV infection
This repository contains both bash and R scripts relating to my PhD thesis. 
The bash scripts were developed to interrogate deep sequencing data within the HCV-GLUE framework developed by Dr Josh Singer.
The R scripts were written to investigate clinical factors associated with spontaneous clearance,evolution of acute HCV infection and the B-cell response following infection.
